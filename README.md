# Bedroom
Bedroom is an open source Java application developed in order to aid call center agents 
in keeping track of their orders and orders per hour in order to meet their quotas effectively.
Due to the pandemic people have started working remotely, working from the bedroom couldn't
get any easier! Or... maybe it just did.

## Documentation for version 2 (currently unreleased, so latest beta)
Orders can only be modified outside of break once clocked in, so shortcuts for them will only work while so.
You can only go on break once currently, setting new break times will override the current ones.

**_Shortcuts:_** 
* _Backspace & Down Arrow_ decrease orders by 1.
* _Up Arrow_ increase orders by 1.
* _0_ Set break times.

_These shortcuts are meant to be unintrusive to work applications,
hence their seemingly random keyboard placements._
