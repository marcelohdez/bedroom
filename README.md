# garage
Garage is an open source Java application developed in order to aid call center agents 
in keeping track of their orders and orders per hour in order to meet their quotas effectively.

## Documentation
Orders can only be modified while clocked in, so shortcuts for them will only work while so.
The clock in/out button is used to begin/stop the timer, therefore it can be used when entering
and leaving breaks as well.

**_Shortcuts:_** 
* _Backspace_ decreases current orders by 1.
* _Up Arrow_ increases current orders by 1.
* _0_ Clocks in/out.

_These shortcuts are meant to be non intrusive to work applications,
hence their seemingly random keyboard placements._
