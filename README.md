# garage
Garage is an open source Java application developed in order to aid call center agents 
in keeping track of their orders and orders per hour in order to meet their quotas effectively.

## Documentation for v1.1 (currently unreleased, so latest beta)
Orders can only be modified while clocked in, so shortcuts for them will only work while so.
You can only go on break once currently, setting new break times will only override the last ones.

**_Shortcuts:_** 
* _Backspace & Down Arrow_ decrease orders by 1.
* _Up Arrow_ increase orders by 1.
* _0_ Enter/leave break.

_These shortcuts are meant to be unintrusive to work applications,
hence their seemingly random keyboard placements._
