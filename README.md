# garage
Garage is an open source Java application developed in order to aid call center agents 
in keeping track of their orders and orders per hour in order to meet their quotas effectively.

## Documentation
Clock in or out when clocking in (duh) or going in/out of break, and when clocking out.
Orders can only be modified while clocked in, so once clocked in is when you can use the
shortcuts for them.

**_Shortcuts:_** Pressing backspace will delete an order in case of errors.
